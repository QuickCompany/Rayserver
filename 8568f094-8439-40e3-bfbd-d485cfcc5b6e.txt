<h2>~Floating Bilayer Tablet of Amoxicillin trihydrate and aqueous extract of Benincasa hiqida fruits"</h2><h2>TITLE OF THE INVENTION</h2><h2>THE FOLLOWING SPECIFICATION DESC RIBES THE NATURE OF TH</h2><p>Floating  Drug  Delivery   System is considered suitable for   treating different   types of gastrointestinal tract infections as it overcomes the difficulties like gagging or choking while swallowing medicinal pills. Bilayer floating tablet remains a novel approach designed for the effective advance of controlled delivery design laterally through numerous sorts to deliver an approach of efficacious drug transport system. Bilayer floating tablet has advantages like Enhanced   bioavailability , Targeted   therapy for ailments in the upper GIT , Reduces fluctuation of drug concentration, Minimise adverse activity at the colon site.</p><p>Ulcers are perforations in the lining of the upper gastrointestinal tract (GI tract) . Peptic ulcer is a sore in the lining of stomach or duodenum due to attack by acid pepsin  While acid is still thought to have a role in ulcer formation, the most common cause of ulcer illness is now thought to be a stomach infection caused by the bacteria Helicobacter 'pylori.</p><p>Various types of treatments are available in the market for treating peptic ulcer in the form of oral medications. Traditional oral dosage forms, such as tablets and capsules, provide a specific drug concentration in systemic circulation that does not release at a constant rate for a long time and does not account for site-   specific absorption rates within the gastrointestinal tract. As a result, there is & need to develop dosage forms that release the drug at the right time and at the desired rate at the right site.</p><p>Few patent and non-patent literature has been retrieved that discloses bilayer tablet for the treatment of peptic ulcers includes: Indian patent application no. 2117/MUM/2014 discloses floating  dosage   form  containing  Ciprofloxacin (Antibacterial) &  Misoprostol (Synthetic Prostaglandin E1 (PGEL) Analog) to serve as antibacterial and also prevent gastric ulcer: AAPS PharmSciTech  2012 Dec; 13(4): 1518-1523,; Arati N.
