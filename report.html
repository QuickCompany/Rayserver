<p>n the state of the art there is a number of inventions which solve the problem of the sensitiveneasurements of the agents in the biological samples. The Us2014273549A1 applicationresents the solution which relates to the multi-electrode single-channel biometric sensore.g. for the measurement of the glucose in blood) in the form of a strip connected with theneasuring device using a slot. The strip contains many fields made of a conductor and the rimof the strip is formed in such a manner to fit the sensor slot and is equipped with manycontacts. The described device contains one measurement segment consisting of a fewelectrode. The w02013114291A1 application relates to the multichannel temperature sensorn form of a plate with the formed tracks leading to the edge connector for connection withhe slot of the sensing device. The plate contains many fields made of a conductor and the rims formed to fit the sensor slot and the plate is equipped with many contact fields (edgeconnectors). The measurements are conducted simultaneously and in parallel. In thedescribed solution each measuring field is an independent measuring system, and multi-hannel character is achieved by the multiplication of measuring systems; the number of theircuit lines is also multiplicated. Each of these measuring systems operates independently,hus the sample measurement is not conducted in the same conditions in each channel.Additionally, such a distribution of electrodes increase the measurement time and does notive the possibility to eliminate the measurement errors.</p>
<p>Us6391558B1 patent presents the system for detection of the nucleic acids based on theelectrochemical method. The system utilises the electrode on the PcB surface including thearray of working and reference electrodes. The electric potential applied to the working.</p>
<p>The subject of the invention is the sensor for the impedance measurements of the biologicaland counting electrode (CE) with the electric contacts leading to the edge of the sensor in theform of the edge connector.</p>
<h3>State of the art</h3>
<p>The international patent application WO2001083674A1 describes the method for detection ofthe reagents using the electrochemical biosensor made of the electrodes covered with themonolayer of the biological molecules, preferably the biotin selectively interacting with thestreptavidin. On the other hand, Moreira et al. (Sensors and Actuators B 223 (2016) 927-935)describe the utilisation of the screen print technology to manufacture the sensors based onthe silver electrodes. The sensor included artificial antibodies recognising cancer biomarkers.The antibodies detection signal was measured using various methods such as cyclicvoltammetry (cv), electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (Esl), squarewave voltammetry</p>
<p>The biosensors based on the electrochemical measurements are often used in the Point-of-Care (PoC) devices. Ward et al. in publication PLOs ONE 2014 9 3 e91732. "Detecting P.aeruginosa with a Novel Biosensor" described the method for the determination ofPseudomonas aeruginosa using Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (Eis). Themeasurement and results analysis are based on the change in the impedance after connection.of the microorganisms via pili, flagella, or extracellular proteins with the biofilm on theelectrode surface what causes the transfer of charge, or by the detection of the metabolitesproduced by the microorganisms.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Us6391558B1 patent describes the nucleic acid detection method using.the electrodes on the printed plates. The electrode can be made of carbon or metals, including.copper, nickel, gold, platinum, palladium, and other. The printed plates are manufacturedusing screen printing and are subsequently subjected to the photolithography. The description.does not cover the possibility to perform the simultaneous measurements on number of.electrodes without multiplexing.</p>
<p>electrode is multiplexed, what enables the detection of various ligands in one sample. Thesensor electrode is connected with the analyser which detects the electric pulses and signalchanges caused by the interactions on the electrode..</p>
<p>The patent application Us20030042150A1 describes the electrochemical sensor for thedetection of the blood parameters, such as glucose concentration, cholesterol level, and other.The system consists of many electrodes enabling the simultaneous measurement of multipleparameters.</p>
<p>The drawback of the inventions described in the state of the art is the lack of possibility toconduct parallel multichannel measurement for all measurements segments, what negativelyinfluences the measurement speed and its accuracy. To conduct the multichannelmeasurements using the solutions described in the state of the art, one sensor system withthe signal multiplexation is used, where in a given while only one measurement segment ispowered and registered, and subsequently the system switches the power and measurementto the next measurement segment. Finally, there is no possibility to perform the simultaneousmeasurement. Each measurement segment has its separate set of electrodes, the generatedmeasurement errors, constant and random, detected on the reference electrodes cannot becompensated in any way because each reference electrode is a separate electric circuit(constant error of each electrode) and the random errors are impossible to define due tomeasurements of segments in various time.</p>
<p>The subject of the present invention is the sensor for the impedance measurements of the.biological or chemical factor sample in the potentiostat system comprising the referenceelectrode RE and the counting electrode CE with the electric contacts leading to the edge of.the sensor in the form of the edge connector which preferably comprises n working electrodesWEn, wherein n>2 and preferably n is in the range 2 to 256, and the reference electrode RE is.common for all working electrodes WEn and the fragment thereof present by the working.electrode WEn forms the measuring segment RE-CE-WEn..</p>
<p>Preferably, at least two, and more preferably all wEn electrodes are covered on the outer.surface with the layer of the sensory material - the material which reacts only with one typeof the biological or chemical factor in the sample..</p>
<h3>Summary of the invention</h3>
<p>Preferably, at least two WEn electrodes are covered with different sensory materials</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, it turned out that the presented invention solves this problem</p>
<p>Preferably, the arrangement of the working electrodes WEn, the counting electrode CE, andthe reference electrode RE constitute a repeating measurement segments of identical shapeand distances in each measurement segments between the working electrode wEn, thecounting electrode CE, and the reference electrode RE are the same, and in addition the areaof working electrode WEn, the counting electrode CE fragment, and the reference electrodeRE fragment are respectively the same in each segment. The shape of the reference electrodeRE includes distribution of the electric field gradient in the polarised sensor reflectingessentially identical potential value in a polarised electrolyte.</p>
<p>Preferably, the working electrodes WEn have the shape of the uniform circles and are locatedsymmetrically to the counting electrode CE, wherein the edges of the counting electrode CEhave the shape of the sections of the circumferences which are concentric with these circleswherein the reference electrode RE is located between the counting electrode CE and theworking electrodes WEn and the shape of the reference electrode RE is the same as thecontour of the counting electrode CE.</p>
<p>Preferably, the sensory material is the material of a biological or synthetic type, and especiallythese are antibodies, antibody fragments, peptides, nucleic acid sequences for the detectionof the biological or chemical factor in the sample..</p>
<p>number of the working electrode WEn, where n>2 and preferably n is in the range of 2 to 256..</p>
<p>Preferably, the arrangement and shape of the working electrodes WEn, the referenceelectrode RE, and the counting electrode CE has its symmetry axis..</p>
<p>Preferably, the edge connector has the contact fields which constitutes an electric circuitindependent of the WEn, RE and CE electrodes intended for the identification of the correct.Iocation of sensor in the slot of the measurement system by connecting the measurement slotcontacts during insertion of the sensor into the slot.</p>
<p>Preferably, it contains 9 contact spots used to code the sensor number.</p>
<p>Preferably, the measurements are conducted in the reverse configuration where thestimulating signal is applied on the WEn electrodes instead of the CE electrode. The reversing.of the electrode configuration enables the obtaining of various result characteristics of the.electrode impedance in comparison with the standard configuration. Present differences arethe result of the non-linearity of the effects occurring in the sensor-biosensible layer-testedsample system. Here both the possibility to reverse the electrode polarisation (thus the.direction of the electric charge movement, including ions in the solution) as well as the change.in the configuration of the measuring system (the measurement method of the currents forthe individual electrodes) are crucial. In particular, by this way it is possible to measure thenon-linearity of the impedance characteristics which is the result of the presence of p-njunctions in the measured systems..</p>
<p>The subject of the present invention is the detection method of the biological or chemical..factor in the sample characterised in that the sample of the biological or chemical factor in theform of the electrolyte or solution is placed in the device according to any of the preceding.claims 1 to 11 that all the working electrodes WEn, counting electrode CE, and the reference.electrode RE are covered with the mentioned sample in the form of solution, and subsequently2 to 256 sample measurements are conducted simultaneously, especially using the impedancespectroscopy technique or the voltammetry and based on the results of these measurementsthe presence of the biological or chemical factor in the sample is determined..</p>

Presentedsensor 1 is equipped with the working electrode WEn 7 where n=8 and the reference electrodeRE 3 is common for all working electrodes WEn 7 and its fragment located near the workingelectrode WEn 7 forms the sensing segment 8 of RE-CE-WEn type.</p>

<p>Invention will be explained in more details in preferred embodiments, with references to thegiven figures, where:</p>
<p>Fig. 2 presents the edge 6 of the sensor 1 in the form of the edge connector with the contact.spots 11 forming the electric circuit separated from the electrodes wEn7, RE 3 and CE 4intended for the identification of correct sensor placement in the measurement slot andadditional 13 connecting and/or non-connecting electrodes to code of the number of theworking electrode WEn 7.</p>
<h3>Preferred embodiments</h3>
<p>Fig. 4 presents the ideogram of the system in the simplified version; the subset of 3 electriccontacts 5 is used for identification, thus the number of combinations is 2^M = 8.Fig. 5 The measurement of the sensor interaction with the positive sample, the lactoseproduct.</p>

<p>Fig. 7 The interaction of the ssDNA-modified sensor with a complementary sequence</p>
<p>Yet, in the presented solution the sensor 1 is not fitted with the HDMl / DP port and anymechanic elements providing similar functionality which prevent from the reverse insertion ofthe sensor into the sensor slot. Thus, without any additional mechanical protection the reverseinsertion of the sensor 1 in the measurement slot is possible, preventing the measurement. Insuch a situation an additional problem is the construction of the standard HDMi/DP port - thecontacts are located in an alternating manner instead of the opposite manner, what in practicemakes it impossible to use the electric contacts 5 on the edge 6 of the edge connector for anunambiguous detection of the reverse insertion of the sensor 1 in the sensor slot. This is dueto the fact that by the reverse insertion the connection spots of the sensor slot and the centresof the electric contacts 5 do not overlap - the connection spot is shifted to the isolated area</p>
<p>The sensor edge connector 1 is mechanically and partially electrically compatible with the.standard HDMI port or DisplayPort. In typical use, ports of HDMI and DisplayPort type areutilised for the transmission of the digital data and contain two rows of contacts in the casing.which maintain the electric connection between the port and the inserted plug. The mechanic.construction of the HDMI / DP ports and plugs prevents their reverse connection..</p>
<p>The working electrode RE 3 and the counting electrode CE 4 are the auxiliary electrodes whichare shared during the measurement with all electrodes WEn 7 and are used to conduct themeasurements of the electric quantities changing due to the chemical processes occurring inthe sensory material 9 placed on the electrodes WEn7 due to the biological or chemical factorintended for the detection in the sample 2</p>
<p>Fig. 9 Top view and cross section of the sensor 1 covered with the sensory material 9 (biologicallayer) and the applied sample 2 of the biological or synthetic factor..</p>
<p>In the preferred embodiment the working electrodes WEn 7 are covered with the sensory.material 9, thus the substance responsible for the detection of the specific biological and.chemical substances and particles in the sample 2, preferably in the form of a solution ora suspension.</p>
<p>Only after detection of the correct sensor 1 orientation in the sensor slot the electric signalsused for the identification of sensor 1 and required for the correct measurement are activated.</p>
<p>Versatility of the sensor includes its use for the detection of various biological or chemicalsubstances. The sensor 1 can be made in many versions which differ in types of sensory.</p>
<p>the sensor slot in the reverse orientation. This is the result of the misfit of clearances betweenthe socket housing and the edge connector and the deviation of the edge 6 of the edgeconnector from the right angle in relation to the socket symmetry axis.Unexpectedly it turned out that even though the exclusion of such a situation is not possible.it is however possible to detect correct or incorrect orientation of the sensor 1 while insertingit into the sensor slot based exclusively on the electrical measurements. It is required to designthe connection spots 11 in such a manner that the part closer to the edge 6 of the sensor 1edge connector is used as the connections spots 11 for the detection of the sensor orientationin the socket, while the other area of the edge connector maintains the electric contact of thesocket connections with the electric contacts 5 connected with the individual sensorelectrodes. The embodiment is presented in the Fig. 2. During insertion of the sensor 1 intothe socket, the temporary connection of the contacts 1-2-3-4 and 6-7-8-9 of the connectionsocket through the connection spots without the connection with the contact 5 occursInvented method for the detection of sensor 1 orientation in relation to the slot is based fullyon the electrical measurements by monitoring of the short circuits between the groups ofelectric connectors during insertion of the sensor 1 into the sensor socket and it does not limitfunctionally or impact the operation of the sensor 1 after its full insertion.The variants of the described solution cover isolation of the connection spots 11 on upper,lower, or both sides of the edge connector in various configurations of the circuited</p>
<h3>Identification of the sensor type</h3>
<p>between the electric contacts 5. As an effect, it is possible to obtain the short-circuit of theneighbouring electric contacts 5 by the slot contact, as well as to obtain the electric connectionwith any of these electric contacts 5. This phenomenon is practically unpredictable and theobtained result can be completely different than the next attempts to insert the sensor 1 inthe sensor slot in the reverse orientation. This is the result of the misfit of clearances betweenthe socket housing and the edge connector and the deviation of the edge 6 of the edgeconnector from the right angle in relation to the socket symmetry axis.</p>
<h3>Example 1</h3>
<p>The variants of the described solution cover isolation of the connection spots 11 on upper,lower, or both sides of the edge connector in various configurations of the circuitedconnections of the sensor slot.</p>
<p>According to the Fig. 3, the electric contacts 5 number 1, 2 leading to the working electrodesWE1 and wE2 7 and the electric contact 5 number 5 were not connected electrically with anylines of the electric contacts 5 of the electrode CE 4, the electrode RE3, GE 14, thus theseelectrodes are used to conduct the measurement of the biological or chemical factor contentThe electric contacts 5 number 3 and 4 are connected with centrally located electrode GE 14.Initial voltage polarisation VPOL in 500 mV to 5V range of all electric contact 5 in reference toGE14 or RE, CE gives the measurement result similar to VGE only for the electric contacts 5, 3,and 4, and the voltage measurement result is similar to VpOl for the electric contacts 5number 1, 2, and 5. The code "11001" is obtained while assigning the potential similar to VGEwith the "0" symbol and one similar to VPOL with the "1" symbol.</p>
<p>The type identification of the sensor 1 is possible using the same electric contacts 5 which areused for the measurements of the working electrodes WEn 7. Coding of the sensor 1 type isconducted by the selection of the subset of N electric contacts 5 from M available, wherein N< M. Selected combination of N electric contacts 5 is further connected with the referenceelectrode RE 3 or the counting electrode CE 4 or the shield electrode GE 14. The sensor electriccircuit detects which electric contacts 5 are connected and the electric contacts 5 connectedin such a way are not used during further steps of the proper measurement.</p>
<p>materials 9 of the working electrode WEn 7 sensitive for the specific selected pathogens orother substances. Therefore, it was necessary to enable the possibility of unambiguousidentification of the type of sensor 1 located in the sensor and based on it to select themeasurement conditions such as stimulation signal values and the measurement time whichcould vary for the individual sensor 1 types. Commonly found solutions are based on thecolorimetric identification, utilisation of the codes based on the optical image analysis (e.g. bar.codes, QR codes) or specialised electronic systems used for the wire or wireless identification.(e.g. RFID).</p>
<p>Presented solution with selected subset of the electric contacts 5 of the edge connector set inany combination connected or not connected with the electrodes GE 14, the electrodes RE 3,or the counting electrodes CE 4 enables the encoding of 2^N various combinations. For theexemplary solution, the subset of the electric contacts 5 used for the identification with N=3.</p>
<p>In case of the presented solution, each individual measurement segment 8 composed of theworking electrode WEn 7 and the corresponding fragment of the reference electrode RE 3 andthe counting electrode CE 4 are identical, i.e. the identical distances between these elementsare kept and area values are kept constant. The potential of the reference electrode RE 3 isconstant in the whole system, resulting with the perfect measuring conditions for the wholesystem. All other electrode pairs operate identically, and the reference electrode RE 3equalises the potential within the surroundings of other electrodes.</p>
<p>results obtained from the individual channelsIn the presented solution of the multichannel sensor 1 the measuring sensors 8 are usecforming the system of the working electrode WEn 7, the working electrode 3, and countingelectrode 4 that each of the measuring segments 8 keeps the identical geometry, especiallyidentical area of the individual electrodes, the distances between the electrodes, and shapesof the electrodes assigned in such a manner that the path of the RE electrode corresponds tothe certain fixed potential in the distribution of the electric force field lines in the polarisecsensor 1.</p>
<p>Fig. 4 presents layout in the simplified version; the subset contains 3 electric contacts 5, thusthe number of combinations is 2AM = 8.</p>
<p>The working electrodes WEn 7, the reference electrodes RE3, the counting electrode CE4 aremade of the material of low resistivity, e.g. copper, which is negligible comparing with theresistivity of the sample 2 or sensory material 9 reacting with the particular chemical andbiological substances, e.g. pathogens being detected.</p>
<h3>Sensor operation</h3>
<p>of the electric contacts 5 enable the unambiguous identification of 8 different types of sensor1. Similarly, for the N=8 it is possible to identify 256 types of the sensor 1.The solution which enables the utilisation of all electric contacts 5 for the identification of thetype of the sensor 1 provides higher number of combinations, namely 32 combinations (2^Mfor M=4).</p>
<p>The multichannel systems exhibit a negative influence of the electric potential gradient on theesults obtained from the individual channels.</p>
<p>It turned out that the besides the beneficial increase in the amount of data about given sample..2 obtained while changing the N1 and N2 methods, the additional advantage is a significant.reduction of the measurement time in comparison with the measurements multiplexedconcerning time, based on the conduction of the separate measurements for the individual.electrodes. The gain in the reduction of measurement time both using N1 and N2 method is.directly proportional to the number of channels and for the 8 channels measured.simultaneously is 8-times shorter than the analogous measurement with the traditional</p>
<p>In comparison with the classic measurement method used in the impedance spectroscopy.with the potentiostat, there is a change in the roles of the working electrode WEn 7 and.the counting electrode CE 4 - the stimulations are generated in such a system by the working.electrodes WEn 7 instead of the counting electrode CE 4. The role of the working electrodeRE7 similarly to the method N1 is the measurement of the potential distribution in theelectrolyte. Unexpectedly, it turned out that the impedance values measured using themethod N2 are different than the values obtained using the traditional method or N1 method,while cyclic switching of the operation mode for the measurement system between N1 andN2 provides additional information about the measured samples.</p>
<p>Unexpectedly it turned out during the conducted tests that the electrode system designed insuch a manner gives both very good repeatability of results independently of the analysedWEn 7 electrode and also enables the utilisation of new impedance measurement methods.</p>
<p>Comparing with the classic impedance spectroscopy with the potentiostat system, the purposeof the reference electrode RE 7 is to measure the potential in the solution of sample 2 in the.form of electrolyte in order to compensate (eliminate) the electrolyte impedance from thefinal result which is the impedance value within the CE-wEn electrode system instead ofreaching the set potential due to the changes in the counting electrode CE 4 potential..</p>
<p>Both N1 and N2 methods are characterised in the lack of limitations typical for the commonlyconducted impedance measurements with the potentiostat system; especially, thesimultaneous execution of the measurement for all working electrodes WEn 7 is possible.</p>
<h3>N2 method</h3>
<h3>N1 measurement method</h3>
<p>The construction and mutual arrangement of the electrodes also enables the usage of the.reverse detection mode. In the classic system the stimulation occurs at the counting electrodeCE 4 and the signal is registered with the working electrode wEn 7. In case of the givensolution, the measurement can be conducted in such a way that the stimulation at the working.electrode WEn 7 and the counting electrode CE 4 is used as a reference for the wholemeasurement system. Reversing of the ion current direction through the electrolyte gives theresult which differs in some frequency range from the result obtained using a traditionalmethod, what improves the device sensitivity and increases its capabilities concerning the.automatic malfunction detection for the sensor 1 or the individual electrodes..</p>
<p>The working electrodes WEn 7 number 1 to 8 are washed with H,SO4 before the measurement.First, the measurement with clean working electrodes WEn 7 is conducted and subsequentlythe sensory material 9 is prepared on them. The sensory material 9 is prepared by:.</p>
<p>The electrolyte, unlike the situation with the classic electrochemical measurements, is just awetting and auxiliary agent for the conduction of electricity and the geometry of electrodes.eliminates the influence of the electrolyte itself on the impedance.</p>
<p>method, i.e. with the time multiplexing</p>
<p>The surface of the working electrode WEn 7 is modified with the beta-galactosidase enzyme.Subsequently, the working electrode WEn 7 is zeroed with the buffer (prepared for work, thusmoistened with the zeroing solution used for the electrode activation) and subsequently thesample 2 is applied as the lactose-containing solution. Fig. 5 shows the distinct change in theimpedance in case of the lactose presence..</p>

<p>The lactose-free sample was used as the control experiment. As shown in Fig. 6, the sensor 1does not exhibit changes during presence of the control sample.</p>
